Navigating the Future: Blockchain’s Impact on Accounting and Auditing Practices. Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887. https://doi.org/10.3390/ su152416887Abstract: This study seeks to meticulously analyze the scholarly discussion on the integration of blockchain technology into accounting and auditing. Based on a total of 67 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database, this study adopts a bibliometrics and content analysis approach which uses both numerical and visualization techniques to examine the extant literature. It spans the timeframe between 2016 and 2022. Bibliometrix R-package (Biblioshiny, version 4 is employed to analyze the descriptive analysis, which includes publication trends, the most trustworthy sources of scientiﬁc pub- lications, prominent scientiﬁc authors, prominent documents, and country collaborations. VOSviewer software Version 1.6.20, is used for a network visualization of keywords and bibliographic coupling. Leveraging the content analysis, this research reveals three fundamental themes: ﬁrst, the use of blockchain technology to strengthen ﬁnancial reporting systems; second, blockchain technology and the future of auditing; and third, the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Research gaps in the current literature include a lack of comprehensive studies on blockchain’s regulatory and governance aspects in accounting, insufﬁcient exploration of risks and challenges in adopting new technologies in au- diting, and a limited understanding of tax consequences, disclosure requirements, and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, necessitating future research endeavors. Thus, this study extends existing theoretical insights by exploring blockchain’s role in ﬁnancial reporting, its transforma- tive impact on auditing, and the possible adaptation or development of new valuation methods for cryptocurrencies. It further identiﬁes and discusses future research directions, contributing to potential novel frameworks for addressing regulatory, governance, and socio-economic dimensions of blockchain integration into accounting and auditing practices.Academic Editors: Yaowen Shan, Quanxi Liang and Meiting LuKeywords: blockchain technology; ﬁnancial reporting; accounting; auditing; bibliometric analysis; content analysisReceived: 18 October 2023 Revised: 30 November 2023 Accepted: 4 December 2023 Published: 15 December 2023'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'Doc_1.pdf', 'title': '1.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/ 4.0/).Worldwide, blockchain technology is expected to achieve USD 1235.71 billion by 2030 compared to USD 5.85 billion in 2021 (a compounded annual growth of 82.8%), effectively underscoring the growing importance and widespread adoption of blockchain technology in diverse industries globally. The year 2016 is commonly known as a signiﬁcant milestone in the accounting discipline as it marked the emergence of blockchain technology [1–4]. This milestone resulted in substantial transformations, fundamentally altering how ac- counting and auditing processes and transactions are managed. While it is acknowledged by certain scholars that the focus of blockchain is more aligned with cryptography rather than accounting [5], it is undeniable that blockchain technology has the capacity to signiﬁ- cantly impact and transform all spheres of accounting. Its ability to automate a range ofSustainability 2023, 15, 16887. https://doi.org/10.3390/su152416887https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2023, 15, 16887accounting processes will eliminate the need for human involvement in routine tasks and signiﬁcantly improve the speed and effectiveness of accounting processes [6,7]. From an auditing perspective, blockchain provides auditors with near-real-time secure and trans- parent data via “read-only” blockchain nodes, facilitating procedures and competencies for data and evidence extraction and assessment in a consistent and recurring manner, thus allowing for greater transparency and visibility in the auditing process.Recognizing the signiﬁcant roles played by accounting and auditing in economic systems, the primary objective of this research endeavor is to utilize a rigorous scien- tiﬁc methodology to conduct an extensive analysis of the existing literature within the domain of blockchain applications in the ﬁelds of accounting and auditing. This compre- hensive analysis encompasses diverse aspects, including publication trends, prominent publications, authors, journals, and country collaborations. More importantly, this study meticulously examines the resulting thematic elements that provide a comprehensive overview of the knowledge landscape pertaining to blockchain applications in accounting and auditing. Research gaps in the current literature include a lack of comprehensive studies on blockchain’s regulatory and governance aspects in accounting, insufﬁcient ex- ploration of risks and challenges in adopting new technologies in auditing, and a limited understanding of tax consequences, disclosure requirements, and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, necessitating future research endeavors. Thus, further research in this domain can contribute to the effective integration of blockchain technology into account- ing and auditing practices and may unveil novel frameworks that address the intricate dimensions of regulation, governance, and socio-economic factors inherent in blockchain integration within these professional domains.Studies have explored blockchain technology in the ﬁeld of accounting, employing structured literature reviews and bibliometric analyses. Refs. [8–10] represent recent ex- amples of such studies, focusing on the intersection of blockchain technology and various domains within the ﬁeld of accounting. Ref. [10] presented a comprehensive summary of the subjects covered in an AAAJ special issue, drawing from a set of eight articles, two of which employed bibliometrics approaches. The authors concluded that the re- search on blockchain technology is currently in an exploratory stage, emphasizing the need for further empirical investigation to derive deﬁnitive conclusions regarding the potential impact of blockchain on accounting, auditing, and accountability domains. The authors of [9] adopted a meticulous approach by examining 153 academic papers pub- lished from 2008 to June 2020, extracted from diverse databases. The researchers’ analysis revealed four recurring themes in the literature: the evolving role of accountants, new challenges for auditors, opportunities and difﬁculties associated with the use of blockchain technology, and legal issues relating to crypto-assets. Similarly, the authors of [8] investi- gated the discipline by analyzing 346 research articles sourced from the Scopus database as of January 2022. Employing bibliometrics analyses, they critically discussed the impact of blockchain technology on accounting and auditing, implications for crypto-assets and ﬁnance, and the transformation of business models and supply chain management.As a continuation of the above studies and to contribute further to the scholarly discussion on blockchain technology in accounting and auditing, the present study also adopts a similar methodology, speciﬁcally focusing on the recent trends in and empirical ﬁndings on accounting, auditing, and reporting for cryptocurrency. To complement the previous research efforts, this study utilizes the Web of Science (WoS) database, providing a different perspective and expanding the scope of analysis. The dataset includes articles published until December 2022, ensuring coverage of the latest developments and insights in the ﬁeld.

This study’s added contribution lies in its comprehensive analysis of the proposed future research by theme, which is anticipated to make a signiﬁcant impact on academic scholarship and a practical contribution. The2 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887future research proposed herein could serve as a foundational framework and explore diverse areas of research, fostering advancements and driving further scholarly discussion, speciﬁcally regarding aspects of governance, current practices, and the challenges faced in the current implementation stage of blockchain technology in accounting and auditing. It should contribute toward exploring ﬁnancial reporting processes through innovative approaches, such as blockchain-based triple-entry bookkeeping, added supplementary veriﬁcation and transparency, and the solidiﬁcation of trust and accuracy in ﬁnancial reporting. Auditing professionals could beneﬁt from the latest updates on blockchain auditing and understanding blockchain-based audit evidence, equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills to leverage blockchain technology effectively, improving audit effectiveness, risk assessment and control considerations, effective audit reporting and communication strategies, and efﬁciency while offering innovative services. The ﬁndings are expected to greatly enhance the body of knowledge in the ﬁeld of blockchain technology application in accounting and auditing.This study has vital signiﬁcance and importance for several compelling reasons. First, in an era marked by accelerating technological advancements, the adoption of blockchain in these domains has the potential to revolutionize traditional practices, promising en- hanced efﬁciency, transparency, and security. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of digital ﬁnance and the imperative to stay ahead of technological disruptions, it is essential for academia, practitioners, and regulatory bodies to comprehend the multifaceted ram- iﬁcations of blockchain’s implementation [11]. Second, the global ﬁnancial ecosystem is increasingly reliant on real-time, trustworthy ﬁnancial data. Blockchain, with its immutable ledger and cryptographic veriﬁcation, offers a paradigm shift in ensuring the integrity and accuracy of ﬁnancial information. This becomes particularly signiﬁcant in an age of mounting ﬁnancial complexities, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and the demand for real-time, high-quality ﬁnancial reporting. Furthermore, substantial investments and atten- tion from leading accounting ﬁrms and regulatory institutions underscore the immediate relevance of this study. The necessity to navigate the intricate challenges and opportunities presented by blockchain in accounting and auditing, including potential disruptions to established business models, ethical considerations, and the evolving role of professionals, is both pressing and unavoidable. Thus, this study’s urgency and novelty are underscored by the transformative potential of blockchain in accounting and auditing, the increasing reliance on accurate ﬁnancial data, understanding its implications, risks, and challenges, and the presence of governance and regulatory controls for maintaining integrity and effectiveness [12].2. Literature Review 2.1. Blockchain Technology and AccountingThe integration of blockchain technology into accounting has the potential to rev- olutionize ﬁnancial record-keeping [13,14]. This innovation offers an immutable and transparent ledger, signiﬁcantly transforming traditional accounting processes. As sug- gested in [14–16] by leveraging decentralized and secure data storage [17], the risk of fraudulent activities is mitigated [18]. The cryptographic nature of blockchain ensures data integrity, reducing the likelihood of tampering or unauthorized alterations. Furthermore, the transparency embedded in blockchain technology enhances the trustworthiness of ﬁ- nancial transactions [16,19,20]. Stakeholders can access a shared real-time ledger, fostering accountability and reducing the opacity inherent in traditional accounting systems. This transformative potential underscores the broader implications of blockchain in redeﬁning the foundations of ﬁnancial record-keeping, paving the way for more secure, efﬁcient, and transparent accounting practices. Implementing this technology can enhance the accuracy and security of ﬁnancial information [20–22] leading to a reduced likelihood of accounting errors and improved information security [23,24]. It also has the potential to streamline accounting procedures, boost the precision and trustworthiness of ﬁnancial data [3,20], offer more efﬁcient control mechanisms, and mitigate risks for businesses [25,26].3 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887Blockchain technology also records transactions across several workstations using an immutable alphanumeric recording method without modifying subsequent blocks [27], elaborating on its impact. This decentralized and tamper-resistant method of recording transactions across multiple workstations, employing an immutable alphanumeric process, has profound implications. It ensures that once a transaction is recorded in a block, it cannot be altered or deleted without consensus from the network participants. This un- alterable nature signiﬁcantly enhances the security and trustworthiness of the recorded information. It enables consensus-based record-keeping without an intermediary, thus decreasing fraud and mistakes [13,16,28]. Its almost real-time settlement, dispersed ledger, irreversibility censorship, and resistance could improve the accounting profession and reduce risks of non-payments, transaction substantiation, veriﬁable records, and block validation [29,30]. This could further lower ledger maintenance and reconciliation expenses, inﬂuencing ﬁnancial reporting and taxes [31,32]. Blockchain transactions are also perma- nent and transparent [33,34], preserving ﬁnancial activity. Blockchain fosters a sense of trust, mitigates instances of fraudulent activities, and ampliﬁes the level of accountability, thereby instigating a transformative effect on conventional ﬁnancial systems through the provision of a secure and transparent ledger for the facilitation of transactions. Blocks store transactions progressively and uniquely. They are encrypted and authenticated through a standard protocol [13,14,35,36]. Blockchain accounting requires smart contracts [37–40] which automatically execute when certain conditions are met. The technique saves data in numerous copies via a distributed peer-to-peer system, minimizing tampering [19].Having said that, blockchain in accounting has technological obstacles; blockchain scal- ability [13,41–43] is a major issue. Processing transactions become increasingly complicated and resource-intensive as the blockchain’s ledger expands, and some ﬁrms may be deterred by slower transaction times and higher costs [44,45]. Blockchain compatibility is another technological issue as several blockchain systems and protocols have distinct characteristics and capabilities [46,47]. Businesses may ﬁnd it challenging to deploy blockchain-based accounting solutions that are compatible with current systems and procedures. Though blockchain technology appears to be highly disruptive [48], it is a competent emerging technology with the capacity to fully re-structure the accounting and auditing environ- ment as well as the competency of the work within it [1,14,49,50]. In order to promote the widespread adoption of this innovation, it is crucial to identify the factors that affect people’s attitudes and intentions to embrace and implement blockchain technology in accounting practices [51].2.2. Blockchain Technology and AuditingBlockchain technology has the potential to also revolutionize the auditing sector by offering a secure, transparent, and automated method of conducting audits. Recent studies [52,53] suggest that blockchain implementation can enhance the speed and effec- tiveness of auditing procedures. By providing a permanent and unalterable record of transactions, blockchain can help auditors verify the accuracy of ﬁnancial information and ensure document integrity [54]. Smart contracts allow for automated processes, reducing time and resource requirements while quickly identifying inconsistencies and areas of con- cern [55]. Furthermore, blockchain enables auditors to access and analyze data from various sources more efﬁciently. It establishes a decentralized ledger that provides a complete and reliable record of ﬁnancial data, facilitating insights and pattern recognition. Blockchain technology also enhances security and mitigates fraud risks [13]. Through its tamper-proof nature, it prevents fraudulent acts such as double-spending and data tampering, thereby increasing auditors’ trust in ﬁnancial data quality. Lastly, blockchain has the potential to foster stakeholder trust and conﬁdence in auditing procedures. By offering a secure and transparent mechanism for audits, blockchain builds conﬁdence among investors, regulators, and the public [3,20]. This, in turn, enhances the reputation of auditors and the organizations they audit, leading to increased investment and growth.4 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887The authors of [22] discussed blockchain’s impact on auditing practices and stated that blockchains can be permissionless and permissioned. Permissionless means that the transaction records can be shared, are monitored by all network users, and are open to everyone. On the other hand, a permissioned blockchain places more restrictions on net- work users and control procedures which results in higher governance mechanisms and an effect on internal and external audits. Thus, a blockchain is a strategy of transforming the auditing process from traditional to “on-chain” transactions in any period. A similar study [3] examined several resources such as literature reviews, professional reports, and websites to identify taxonomy themes. The study concluded that blockchain affects the implication of the auditing profession. On one hand, using a blockchain poses many challenges such as fully integrating blockchain technology with the ﬁeld of auditing, which requires more consensus between regulators and auditors [13]. On the other hand, the au- thors of [56] concluded that blockchains are a good solution to save time and overlap work in auditing practices as well as good control mechanisms to prevent fraud, but blockchain technology does not have enough evidence and integrity in the auditing profession; a similar result was found in United Arab Emirates in [57]. Also, blockchains and artiﬁcial intelligence affect real-time trusted data for the AI systems used by auditors to improve assurance and efﬁciency [20]. Another study [58] in Switzerland used the grounded theory for an in-depth understanding of the effect of blockchain on auditing practices. They concluded that there are no potential disruptive effects on the auditing profession, but it could shift in terms of becoming more IT-oriented, and the audit proﬁle total will be changed, which supports the same results found in [59]. In addition, Ref. [60] supported the idea that blockchain technology cannot replace personal auditors’ professionalism, but it can be used to reinvent old practices rather than overwhelm them. A banking sector study [61] conducted in Egyptian banks from 2017 to 2021 concluded that the effect of blockchain technology on auditing has six key levels in terms of saving time and improving efﬁciency, using all whole-population-instated samples, focusing on audit testing, setting up a continuous audit process, playing a more strategic auditing role, and developing new advisory services. Also, the study concluded that blockchain improved audit quality in the banking sector.Therefore, blockchain technology poses various risks and challenges related to security, reliability, and veriﬁcation which need to be addressed through effective governance. In this regard, previous studies set several key points and argued the importance of governance mechanisms for control. Firstly, security and facing risks such as double spending, smart contract vulnerabilities, and privacy concerns can compromise blockchain security [62,63]. Thus, governance should focus on protection against attacks, code reviews, security audits, and data privacy [63]. Secondly, regarding reliability, scalability issues, network forks, and consensus mechanism choices can impact a blockchain’s reliability [64,65]. Therefore, governance plays a critical role in decisions regarding upgrades, network stability during forks, and consensus algorithm selection [64,65]. Finally, with regard to veriﬁcation, the challenges related to identity veriﬁcation, data integrity, and regulatory compliance need governance solutions [66,67]. Thus, establishing standards for identity veriﬁcation, data accuracy, and regulatory compliance is essential. Overall, effective governance is essential to address these issues and ensure the security, reliability, and accuracy of blockchain networks. Regulatory bodies, industry consortia, and blockchain project teams must collaborate to establish governance frameworks that protect participants and maintain network integrity, especially in the accounting and auditing profession.Finally, there are several recent research concepts such as BlockASP, AOP, and OSM that have argued their relationships with the auditing profession. BlockASP is a research framework designed for verifying the correctness and reliability of blockchain systems using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and model-checking techniques [68–70]. AOP allows for modularizing various aspects of blockchain functionality, while model checking systematically validates the blockchain system against speciﬁed properties. The frame- work aims to enhance the security and veriﬁcation of blockchain systems by addressing5 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887their complexity through structured and formalized development and veriﬁcation pro- cesses. It serves as a tool for researchers and developers to improve the trustworthiness of blockchain technology. BlockASP, a framework for verifying the correctness and reliability of blockchain systems, aligns with auditing practices in several ways [71,72]. It can assist auditors in conducting security, compliance, and data integrity audits, especially in the context of blockchain-based ﬁnancial transactions. BlockASP’s AOP-based model checking and focus on regulatory compliance provide valuable tools for auditors to assess security, accuracy, and adherence to regulations within blockchain systems. This framework can enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of blockchain-based ﬁnancial operations, a critical aspect of auditing in this context [71,72]. Moreover, the advanced observe-based sta- tistical model-checking (OSM) framework helps the leveraging model check for observing dynamic behaviors in aspect-oriented applications [68,73]. This framework could indirectly relate to auditing practices by offering insights into software auditing. Moreover, OSM emphasizes the use of model checking to observe and assess the dynamic behaviors of software systems [74,75], which is essential for auditors who need to evaluate the security, reliability, and compliance of ﬁnancial software.Thus, blockchain technology could improve the auditing profession regarding secu- rity, reliability, and veriﬁcation by providing an immutable and transparent ledger that enhances the security and reliability of ﬁnancial records. In addition, real-time and con- tinuous auditing on a blockchain enables proactive issue identiﬁcation. At the same time, smart contracts automate audit procedures and reduce the risk of human error, improving both security and reliability. Moreover, the technology’s ability to verify data accuracy and reduce fraud risk enhances the audit process’s reliability and security. Additionally, blockchain supports privacy and regulatory compliance, ensuring secure audits without vi- olating data privacy regulations and increasing the reliability of compliance audits. Overall, blockchain enhances the trustworthiness and effectiveness of the auditing profession.2.3. Blockchain Technology and CryptocurrenciesBlockchain technology, which is based on the principles of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency [76], has attracted a lot of interest since it offers improved security and anonymity for a variety of applications. However, the current research being conducted in this particular area of study unveils a multifaceted and intricate terrain. The authors of [77] emphasize the potential of Proof-of-Work techniques and dynamic Public Keys in safeguarding transaction security and user privacy. Nevertheless, the authors of [61] assert that despite its revolutionary potential, the general acceptance of blockchain technology continues to pose a substantial challenge. The achievement of success in this undertaking is significantly impacted by various aspects, such as regulatory assistance and user experience, as extensively examined in [78]. The aforementioned difficulties necessitate a thorough examination in order to fully use the promise of blockchain technology. The exponential growth of blockchain technology has led to its widespread adoption across several domains. One study [79] highlights China’s notable emphasis on the integration of blockchain technology across many industries and smart cities. In contrast, international research largely centers around the implications of blockchain technology within the financial sector. However, Ref. [80] highlights the unique issues associated with the legal recognition of cryptocurrencies, which are supported by blockchain technology. Additionally, it should be noted that there are certain disparities between the capabilities of blockchain technology and the unique requirements of the FinTech business, as highlighted in [81]. The presence of this incongruity warrants a more thorough examination in order to successfully reconcile the disparity.The continuously developing blockchain ecosystem has extensive ramiﬁcations that extend beyond the realm of technology, inﬂuencing societal trust and institutional dynam- ics, as demonstrated by the research conducted in [82]. Concurrently, there is a growing trend in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the realm of electronic commerce, lever- aging the robust security attributes of blockchain technology to enhance their acceptance and utilization [83]. Nevertheless, the ever-evolving nature of blockchain technology6 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887emphasizes the necessity of thorough surveys aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and proactively preparing for future advancements. The interrelationship between blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is apparent within the financial domain since the profitability of cryptocurrencies is closely linked to the performance of enterprises utilizing blockchain- based technology, as stated in [84]. The importance of regulatory monitoring, managerial engagement, and investor participation is highlighted by this symbiotic relationship [85]. Furthermore, the authors of [86] argue that these innovations are fundamentally transforming the social and solidarity-based finance sectors, with blockchain technology emerging as a potentially disruptive influence. However, the emergence of digital finance presents certain obstacles in meeting the financial requirements of low-income groups, notwithstanding its advantages [87]. Moreover, the interdependent development of blockchain technology, crowd- funding platforms, cryptocurrencies, and initial coin offerings (ICOs) represents a significant transformation in the public dialogue surrounding entrepreneurial financing, as evidenced by the research conducted in [88]. In conclusion, Industry 4.0 has a great deal of promise for blockchain technology, but in order to detect and address any security flaws, constant moni- toring is necessary [89,90]. These multifaceted developments underscore the importance of continuous scrutiny and proactive engagement from stakeholders in the financial landscape.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'Doc_1.pdf', 'title': '5. Conclusions'}, page_content='5. Conclusions: This study conducted bibliometric and content analyses of the application of blockchain technology within the domains of accounting and auditing. The results of the bibliometric and content analyses explicitly answered the research questions proposed in this study. The empirical results show an increasing trend in the number of publications, with sev- eral prominent authors, publishers, and documents. The Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting is the most cited journal, in addition to several other prominent ones, in- cluding three top accounting journals under the umbrella of the American Association of Accounting. Jun Dai and Miklos A. Vasarhelyi emerged as top authors in the area of blockchain technology in accounting and auditing with their publication titled ”Toward Blockchain-Based Accounting and Assurance” published in the Journal of Information Sys- tems. In terms of geographical location, the USA seems to have the highest number of publications in this domain. The bibliographic coupling and content analyses highlight three important themes: Theme 1, the use of blockchain technology to strengthen ﬁnancial reporting systems; Theme 2, blockchain technology and the future of auditing; and Theme 3, the valuation of cryptocurrencies.This study also demonstrated that blockchain technology has the potential to transform accounting and auditing practices by offering features such as transparency, immutability, security, and decentralization. The integration of triple-entry accounting can enhance the precision, reliability, and transparency of ﬁnancial information while reducing the risk of malfeasance and instilling stakeholder conﬁdence in ﬁnancial reporting. The imple- mentation of blockchain technology can automate repetitive accounting tasks, enabling professionals to focus on higher-level activities like aligning competitive intelligence with business strategy and decision making. It also streamlines the auditing process by providing real-time access to ﬁnancial information, enhancing audit trail transparency, reducing costs and time, and ensuring reliable and tamper-proof evidence. The studies also suggested that blockchain technology can stimulate the emergence of new business models in the accounting and auditing industry, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) which operate without intermediaries, resulting in cost reduction, increased efﬁciency, and improved transparency.However, this review of the studies also acknowledges the challenges and limitations associated with the adoption of blockchain in accounting and auditing, including regula- tory issues, privacy concerns, scalability, interoperability, and technical complexities [137]. To overcome these obstacles and realize blockchain’s full potential in the accounting and auditing sectors, the regulatory community, legislators, industry leaders, and academics will need to work together and fully leverage the potential of blockchain technology. In con- clusion, while some perceive blockchain more as a coding technology than an accounting technology [5], it is crucial for accountants and auditors to closely monitor rapid innovations in blockchain technology. Blockchain has the potential to reshape accounting procedures, practices, and processes, [55], and though it may be disruptive, its beneﬁts are vast. Thus, further research is essential to understand and address the challenges associated with the adoption of blockchain in accounting and auditing and to harness its transformative potential while ensuring regulatory compliance and maintaining privacy and scalability.20 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887As part of the signiﬁcant contribution to the literature, this study identiﬁed potential future research directions under each theme (as discussed in depth in Section 4.7). The highlights of future research include (i) regulatory and governance aspects of blockchain application and its risks, challenges, and issues related to continuous technological enhancement; (ii) the investigation of new technology applications in auditing and the resulting risks and challenges; and (iii) examining the tax consequences related to cryptocurrencies, disclosure requirements, regulatory frameworks, and the auditing of Bitcoin transactions.In conclusion, this research aspires to comprehensively explore existing scholarly discussions in the application of blockchain technology within accounting and auditing domains. The ﬁndings from this investigation are intended not only to contribute valuable insights into the ongoing academic discourse but also to highlight to all stakeholders the importance of the seamless integration of blockchain technology into accounting and auditing practices. As highlighted in [3,20], the envisioned outcomes include a heightened awareness of risks and challenges, the establishment of robust governance structures, and the formulation of effective frameworks. These collective efforts are anticipated to culminate in elevated transparency, heightened visibility, and overall efﬁciency within the domains of accounting and auditing.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, S.S.; methodology, S.S.; software, S.S.; formal analysis, S.S. and K.T.; resources, S.S.; data curation, S.S.; writing—original, S.S., A.A.A. and K.T.; writing—review, S.S., A.A.A., K.T. and I.I.; funding acquisition, S.S., I.I. and A.A.A.

Conclusions: This study conducted bibliometric and content analyses of the application of blockchain technology within the domains of accounting and auditing. The results of the bibliometric and content analyses explicitly answered the research questions proposed in this study. The empirical results show an increasing trend in the number of publications, with sev- eral prominent authors, publishers, and documents. The Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting is the most cited journal, in addition to several other prominent ones, in- cluding three top accounting journals under the umbrella of the American Association of Accounting. Jun Dai and Miklos A. Vasarhelyi emerged as top authors in the area of blockchain technology in accounting and auditing with their publication titled ”Toward Blockchain-Based Accounting and Assurance” published in the Journal of Information Sys- tems. In terms of geographical location, the USA seems to have the highest number of publications in this domain. The bibliographic coupling and content analyses highlight three important themes: Theme 1, the use of blockchain technology to strengthen ﬁnancial reporting systems; Theme 2, blockchain technology and the future of auditing; and Theme 3, the valuation of cryptocurrencies.This study also demonstrated that blockchain technology has the potential to transform accounting and auditing practices by offering features such as transparency, immutability, security, and decentralization. The integration of triple-entry accounting can enhance the precision, reliability, and transparency of ﬁnancial information while reducing the risk of malfeasance and instilling stakeholder conﬁdence in ﬁnancial reporting. The imple- mentation of blockchain technology can automate repetitive accounting tasks, enabling professionals to focus on higher-level activities like aligning competitive intelligence with business strategy and decision making. It also streamlines the auditing process by providing real-time access to ﬁnancial information, enhancing audit trail transparency, reducing costs and time, and ensuring reliable and tamper-proof evidence. The studies also suggested that blockchain technology can stimulate the emergence of new business models in the accounting and auditing industry, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) which operate without intermediaries, resulting in cost reduction, increased efﬁciency, and improved transparency.However, this review of the studies also acknowledges the challenges and limitations associated with the adoption of blockchain in accounting and auditing, including regula- tory issues, privacy concerns, scalability, interoperability, and technical complexities [137]. To overcome these obstacles and realize blockchain’s full potential in the accounting and auditing sectors, the regulatory community, legislators, industry leaders, and academics will need to work together and fully leverage the potential of blockchain technology. In con- clusion, while some perceive blockchain more as a coding technology than an accounting technology [5], it is crucial for accountants and auditors to closely monitor rapid innovations in blockchain technology. Blockchain has the potential to reshape accounting procedures, practices, and processes, [55], and though it may be disruptive, its beneﬁts are vast. Thus, further research is essential to understand and address the challenges associated with the adoption of blockchain in accounting and auditing and to harness its transformative potential while ensuring regulatory compliance and maintaining privacy and scalability.20 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887As part of the signiﬁcant contribution to the literature, this study identiﬁed potential future research directions under each theme (as discussed in depth in Section 4.7). The highlights of future research include (i) regulatory and governance aspects of blockchain application and its risks, challenges, and issues related to continuous technological enhancement; (ii) the investigation of new technology applications in auditing and the resulting risks and challenges; and (iii) examining the tax consequences related to cryptocurrencies, disclosure requirements, regulatory frameworks, and the auditing of Bitcoin transactions.In conclusion, this research aspires to comprehensively explore existing scholarly discussions in the application of blockchain technology within accounting and auditing domains. The ﬁndings from this investigation are intended not only to contribute valuable insights into the ongoing academic discourse but also to highlight to all stakeholders the importance of the seamless integration of blockchain technology into accounting and auditing practices. As highlighted in [3,20], the envisioned outcomes include a heightened awareness of risks and challenges, the establishment of robust governance structures, and the formulation of effective frameworks. These collective efforts are anticipated to culminate in elevated transparency, heightened visibility, and overall efﬁciency within the domains of accounting and auditing.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, S.S.; methodology, S.S.; software, S.S.; formal analysis, S.S. and K.T.; resources, S.S.; data curation, S.S.; writing—original, S.S., A.A.A. and K.T.; writing—review, S.S., A.A.A., K.T. and I.I.; funding acquisition, S.S., I.I. and A.A.A.

Materials and Methods: This research employs a bibliometric analysis to examine the scholarly literature and academic discourse concerning blockchain technology in accounting and auditing. Numerical and graphical strategies are utilized, aligning with earlier studies [91,92]. Web of Science (WoS) is chosen for its rigorous and quality-focused coverage of reliable journals, supporting this study’s purpose [47,65]. Bibliometrix and VOSviewer are employed for a thorough analysis and visualization of the scholarly landscape. Bibliometrix enables various academic analyses, addressing research questions related to publication trends, authors, sources, and collaboration patterns (RQ1 and RQ2). VOSviewer aids in network visualization and bibliographic coupling pertinent to thematic analysis and future research (RQ3 and RQ4). These methodological tools collectively serve the study’s objectives in comprehensively exploring blockchain’s role in accounting and auditing, as exhibited in the following research questions.RQ1: What are the trends in publications on blockchain technology within the realms of accounting and auditing?RQ2: Which are the major sources, documents, authors, institutions, and countries con- tributing toward blockchain technology within the realms of accounting and auditing? RQ3: What are the major themes of blockchain technology within the realms of accountingand auditing?RQ4: What are potential future areas of research on blockchain technology within the realms of accounting and auditing?3.1. Data Extraction and Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaFor this bibliometric analysis, the Web of Science Core database was searched exten- sively beginning in January 2023 in order to gather data regarding the papers. A systematic search was performed, including the title, abstract, and keyword list, utilizing the speciﬁed terms “blockchain in accounting” OR “blockchain in auditing.” This meticulous process yielded the discovery of a total of 999 scholarly publications. The study employed strin- gent criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and a comprehensive search was subsequently conducted using the terms “Economics” and “Management.” This process yielded a cu- rated selection of 402 scientiﬁc papers. These domains exhibit a strong correlation with accounting and auditing, thereby offering a complete comprehension of the economic and managerial implications associated with the use of blockchain technology in accounting and auditing practices. The utilization of these speciﬁc keywords aligns with prior bibliometrics investigations into the application of blockchain technology in the ﬁelds of accounting and auditing, as demonstrated by the scholarly works described in [4,93]. Incorporating these7 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887speciﬁc terms into the search strategy guarantees that the study encompasses pertinent scholarly literature that offers valuable perspectives on the economic and managerial con- sequences of blockchain technology in the ﬁelds of accounting and auditing. Following this, the scope was reﬁned to encompass scholarly articles exclusively published in the English language within the disciplines of economics, business, business ﬁnance, and man- agement. As a result, a total of 203 pertinent academic publications were identiﬁed. A more precise selection was made by implementing ﬁlters to exclusively include papers classiﬁed as “Article” or “Early Access” and published within the timeframe of 2016 to 2022. This resulted in a ﬁnal corpus consisting of 67 articles. The search technique and criteria for source selection were developed with the aim of maintaining a rigorous and high level of quality, as indicated in [47]. The chosen methodological approach is consistent with the norms of bibliometric analysis and guarantees the thorough inclusion of pertinent scholarly literature in the domain of blockchain in accounting and auditing.  3.2. Data Analysis  To analyze the data, we employed the Bibliometrix R-package Version 4 (Biblioshiny) application [94] for a descriptive analysis [91], as well as the VOSviewer software 1.6.20 [94] for a network visualization of keywords and bibliographic coupling [91,92]. In the bibliometrics section, we examined the summary of the main information, publication trends, most relevant authors, sources, affiliations, documents, and a country collaboration analysis. VOSviewer was used for clustering the network—“keyword analysis” and “bibliographic coupling” [94]. Based on the bibliographic coupling, this study performed a content analysis and identified themes and future research for blockchain adoption in accounting and auditing. Figure 1 delineates the search criteria (keywords, inclusion, and exclusion) and the subsequent analysis. Figure 1. Search parameters and data analysis framework.8 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887For the descriptive analysis, we used the Bibliometrix R-package (Biblioshiny) applica- tion [94], and for the network visualization of keywords and bibliographic coupling, we used VOSviewer software [91,92,94]. In the bibliometrics section, we conducted an analysis of several aspects including a summary of the main information, publication trends, most relevant authors, sources, afﬁliations, documents, and a country collaboration analysis. The clustering of the network was conducted using VOSviewer, a software tool that employs techniques such as keyword analysis and bibliographic coupling [94]. This study utilized bibliographic coupling to conduct a content analysis, resulting in the identiﬁcation of themes and potential avenues for future research pertaining to blockchain adoption in accounting and auditing. Figure 1 illustrates the search parameters employed, including keywords as well as the criteria for inclusion and exclusion. The subsequent analysis is also depicted in the ﬁgure.']}"

Navigating the Future: Blockchain’s Impact on Accounting and Auditing Practices. Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887. https://doi.org/10.3390/ su152416887Abstract: This study seeks to meticulously analyze the scholarly discussion on the integration of blockchain technology into accounting and auditing. Based on a total of 67 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database, this study adopts a bibliometrics and content analysis approach which uses both numerical and visualization techniques to examine the extant literature. It spans the timeframe between 2016 and 2022. Bibliometrix R-package (Biblioshiny, version 4 is employed to analyze the descriptive analysis, which includes publication trends, the most trustworthy sources of scientiﬁc pub- lications, prominent scientiﬁc authors, prominent documents, and country collaborations. VOSviewer software Version 1.6.20, is used for a network visualization of keywords and bibliographic coupling. Leveraging the content analysis, this research reveals three fundamental themes: ﬁrst, the use of blockchain technology to strengthen ﬁnancial reporting systems; second, blockchain technology and the future of auditing; and third, the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Research gaps in the current literature include a lack of comprehensive studies on blockchain’s regulatory and governance aspects in accounting, insufﬁcient exploration of risks and challenges in adopting new technologies in au- diting, and a limited understanding of tax consequences, disclosure requirements, and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, necessitating future research endeavors. Thus, this study extends existing theoretical insights by exploring blockchain’s role in ﬁnancial reporting, its transforma- tive impact on auditing, and the possible adaptation or development of new valuation methods for cryptocurrencies. It further identiﬁes and discusses future research directions, contributing to potential novel frameworks for addressing regulatory, governance, and socio-economic dimensions of blockchain integration into accounting and auditing practices.Academic Editors: Yaowen Shan, Quanxi Liang and Meiting LuKeywords: blockchain technology; ﬁnancial reporting; accounting; auditing; bibliometric analysis; content analysisReceived: 18 October 2023 Revised: 30 November 2023 Accepted: 4 December 2023 Published: 15 December 2023\\n---\\n3. Materials and Methods: This research employs a bibliometric analysis to examine the scholarly literature and academic discourse concerning blockchain technology in accounting and auditing. Numerical and graphical strategies are utilized, aligning with earlier studies [91,92]. Web of Science (WoS) is chosen for its rigorous and quality-focused coverage of reliable journals, supporting this study’s purpose [47,65]. Bibliometrix and VOSviewer are employed for a thorough analysis and visualization of the scholarly landscape. Bibliometrix enables various academic analyses, addressing research questions related to publication trends, authors, sources, and collaboration patterns (RQ1 and RQ2). VOSviewer aids in network visualization and bibliographic coupling pertinent to thematic analysis and future research (RQ3 and RQ4). These methodological tools collectively serve the study’s objectives in comprehensively exploring blockchain’s role in accounting and auditing, as exhibited in the following research questions.RQ1: What are the trends in publications on blockchain technology within the realms of accounting and auditing?RQ2: Which are the major sources, documents, authors, institutions, and countries con- tributing toward blockchain technology within the realms of accounting and auditing? RQ3: What are the major themes of blockchain technology within the realms of accountingand auditing?RQ4: What are potential future areas of research on blockchain technology within the realms of accounting and auditing?3.1. Data Extraction and Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaFor this bibliometric analysis, the Web of Science Core database was searched exten- sively beginning in January 2023 in order to gather data regarding the papers. A systematic search was performed, including the title, abstract, and keyword list, utilizing the speciﬁed terms “blockchain in accounting” OR “blockchain in auditing.” This meticulous process yielded the discovery of a total of 999 scholarly publications. The study employed strin- gent criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and a comprehensive search was subsequently conducted using the terms “Economics” and “Management.” This process yielded a cu- rated selection of 402 scientiﬁc papers. These domains exhibit a strong correlation with accounting and auditing, thereby offering a complete comprehension of the economic and managerial implications associated with the use of blockchain technology in accounting and auditing practices.

We characterize their exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar by ﬁtting parametric distributions to them. It is shown that returns are clearly non-normal, however, no single distribution ﬁts well jointly to all the cryptocurrencies analysed. We ﬁnd that for the most popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, the generalized hyperbolic distribution gives the best ﬁt, while for the smaller cryptocurrencies the normal inverse Gaussian distribution, generalized t distribution, and Laplace distribution give good ﬁts.

Distributions Fitted: Having brieﬂy examined the summary statistics for both the exchange rates and the log returns of exchange rates of the seven cryptocurrencies, we provide a visual representation of the distribution of the log returns. Figure 1 shows the histograms of the daily log returns of the exchange rate (versus the U.S. Dollar) for all seven cryptocurrencies. From the plots, we ﬁnd that the log returns in the cases of all seven cryptocurrencies show signiﬁcant deviation from the normal distribution.

Literature Review: The advent of cryptocurrencies and the development of blockchain technology have been transformative and paradigm-shifting forces in the world of finance, prompting the need to rethink long-held assumptions and standards. This literature study delves into the complex world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, analyzing its effects on the banking industry in the UK and USA, the stock market, and other areas related to finance. This study aims to provide complete knowledge of the developing role of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the financial sector by reviewing a wide variety of academic publications, empirical investigations, and industry reports.2.1. Cryptocurrencies: Transforming Financial MarketsAccording to recent research, cryptocurrencies have the ability to fundamentally alter existing monetary systems (Chang et al. 2019). Beyond their function as digital instruments of trade, the complexities of cryptocurrencies are investigated here. They may, nevertheless, serve as powerful disruptors, sparking fundamental changes in market dynamics (Chang et al. 2019). Digital currencies, spearheaded by the revolutionary Bitcoin, are a new kind of investment3 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58instrument that defies established conventions. Research by academics like Baur et al. (2018) and Cheah and Fry (2015) highlights the diversification advantages of Bitcoin investing. In addition, the research shows how the incorporation of these methods into conventional portfolios has altered the risk profiles of investment strategies (Osmani et al. 2020).The rise of cryptocurrencies as a separate asset class has prompted a rethinking of how investors diversify their holdings. Their infancy is a factor in the extreme volatility that has been compared to both speculative bubbles and game-changing breakthroughs (Gandal et al. 2018; Sadiq et al. 2023). It is important to note that market mood and investor behavior have a significant impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies (Gandal et al. 2018). Recent market changes have emphasized the need for investors in the United Kingdom and United States to review their risk tolerance and investing strategies. Cryptocurrency adoption adds a new level of complexity to existing risk management systems, which might have far-reaching effects on the international financial system (Chen and Bellavitis 2019). Narayanan et al. (2020) argues that the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies to traditional financial institutions represents a paradigm shift. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is shaking up a financial system that has relied on centralized institutions for decades (Narayanan et al. 2020). Remittances, foreign payments, and peer-to-peer deals are all impacted by the use of cryptography, which in turn influences the environment in which these activities may take place (Narayanan et al. 2020).Inquiries into the consequences for monetary policy and financial stability are war- ranted in light of the fact that cryptocurrencies provide a serious threat to the monopoly of central banks in currency supply (Yermack 2013). Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are gaining momentum as a reaction to Bitcoin’s popularity (Prasad 2014). As a result, the dynamic between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies creates a complicated nexus that calls for careful analysis within the context of the development of financial markets. Cryptocurren- cies have progressed well beyond their original function as digital tokens, ushering in a new age of unparalleled upheaval inside monetary institutions (Duchenne 2018). Portfolio diversification, volatility in the United Kingdom and United States financial markets, and reevaluation of traditional financial intermediaries are only some of the topics that will be discussed in the next discussion (Duchenne 2018). The emergence of cryptocurrencies has also sparked discussions about the central banks of the future and the far-reaching effects this may have on monetary systems. Cryptocurrencies will have long-lasting effects on financial markets, forcing established players to rethink their strategies and grab new possibilities presented by the ongoing digital transformation.The next sections will dive into the evolution of conventional banking institutions to reflect these new realities, and the possible uses of blockchain technology in the financial industry will be investigated.2.2. Adapting Traditional Banking SystemsThe introduction of cryptocurrencies marked the beginning of a new age of financial innovation, forcing traditional banking institutions to undertake a radical transformation to maintain their relevance in the modern digital economy. Traditional financial institutions are adapting to the possibilities and threats posed by the cryptocurrency revolution, and this section looks into that nuanced process.

ImplicationsThe investigation, “Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology: Studying the Impact of Cryptocurrencies on Financial Markets and Traditional Banking Systems, or Delving into the Potential Applications of Blockchain Technology in Finance,” shed light on a complex landscape with far-reaching consequences for the banking sector, traditional financial systems, regulatory frameworks, and the global economy as a whole. Insights, thoughts, and possible implications resulting from the use and integration of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have been exposed via this in-depth debate.11 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 585.1.1. Transformation of Financial MarketsThere has been a paradigm change in investing methods and asset classes, and the influence of cryptocurrencies on financial markets is critically examined. Table 1 displays the statistics on the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which might affect the diversi- fication and returns of more conventional investing portfolios. Bitcoin and Ethereum’s rising popularity as investments reflects the expanding recognition of cryptocurrencies as alternative assets, which is changing the way portfolios are managed.5.1.2. Adaptation of Banking SystemsAs shown in Table 3, two examples of how conventional banking systems are strategi- cally navigating the cryptocurrency environment are the integration strategies of Barclays and Citigroup. A growing number of banks and other financial organizations, as seen by these projects, are beginning to recognize the game-changing potential of blockchain technology. However, the accompanying difficulties illustrate the fine balance that banks must find between innovation and risk reduction, such as regulatory compliance and cybersecurity concerns.5.1.3. Issues of Policy and RegulationThe approaches to cryptocurrency regulation in the United Kingdom and United States, as well as proposals from international organizations, are discussed in detail in Tables 7 and 8. While the United Kingdom adopts a proactive, innovation-focused strategy, the United States takes a more conservative, investor-protecting position. Global cooperation is en- couraged by the suggestions of the Financial Stability Board and International Monetary Fund. Decisions made by regulators have far-reaching effects on markets, innovations in technology, and global competition.5.1.4. The Future of Blockchain in the Financial SectorThe revolutionary power of blockchain technology in the financial services indus- try is seen in Tables 4–6. The ramifications extend well beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the delivery of financial services due to its capacity to improve Know Your Customer and Anti- Money Laundering compliance, enable real-time transaction monitoring, and democratize investing via asset tokenization. The critical study highlights the need to address technolog- ical problems, legislative impediments, and user education to realize these revolutionary advantages in full.5.1.5. Future Research and International CooperationInternational cooperation is necessary to handle the global consequences of cryptocur- rencies, as shown by a critical study of the suggestions for coordinated regulatory actions. Future study will be crucial in elucidating the long-term ramifications of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as they continue to develop. Scholars and professionals alike need to investigate questions like how Bitcoin adoption will affect economies, how effective are existing regulatory frameworks, and what kind of ethical considerations should be made when dealing with decentralized finance.The conclusions derived from this extensive debate have far-reaching repercussions, not only in monetary and technological spheres. The convergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology raises questions about long-held assumptions, forces regulators to reevaluate their methods, and compels financial institutions to experiment or be left behind. It is important to weigh the advantages of enhanced accessibility, efficiency, and transparency against the dangers of volatility, security flaws, and regulatory ambiguity. For cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to be integrated into the fabric of contemporary finance in a way that is both sustainable and fair, we need to adopt a holistic strategy that encourages innovation while protecting regulatory integrity as we go forward in this rapidly changing world.12 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 585.2. Future DirectionsSeveral important future trends are set to impact the landscape of banking, technology, and the global economy as the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology continues to expand. In light of what has been learned and discussed thus far, more investigation into the following topics is needed in the next years: The ever-changing nature of cryptocurrencies calls for regulatory frameworks that can move with the times while also protecting consumers and businesses. Understanding the effects of various regulatory measures on investor confidence, market honesty, and technical progress is crucial for future studies. Furthermore, international organizations have stressed the need to establish global standards for cryptoasset regulation as a means of providing uniform and harmonized international supervision. DeFi’s potential to revolutionize the financial service industry is enormous, and it should be further studied. Research on the long-term viability of DeFi systems should focus on issues including scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance. As a corollary, it will be important to evaluate how open financial systems affect financial inclusion, wealth distribution, and conventional banking practices. Cybersecurity and data privacy are of paramount importance in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. Proactive security measures against hacking and protection of user identity should be the subject of future studies. There is hope for a compromise between openness and people’s right to privacy thanks to privacy-enhancing technology built into blockchain, such as zero-knowledge proofs.A growing number of people are interested in central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs). The implications of CBDC adoption on monetary policy, financial stability, international trade, and the economy as a whole should be investigated in future studies. Furthermore, it is important to examine the connections between CBDCs, cryptocurrencies, and conventional banking. There is rising worry about the potential negative effects of blockchain technology on the environment, in particular its high energy requirements. Energy-efficient consensus procedures and sustainable blockchain infrastructures should be the focus of future study. For blockchain technology to survive in the long run, it will be essential to learn about the environmental impact of different networks and suggest greener options. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology raise important ethical questions that need to be thoroughly investigated. Problems like the “digital divide,” “wealth inequality,” and “the potential for new forms of financial exclusion” need to be investigated in the future. Understanding the moral implications of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and tokenization is crucial for building equitable financial infrastructure. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have many applications, thus experts from different fields must work together. Financial, technological, legal, economic, social, and ethical scholars should work together in future studies. Researchers may provide complete answers to complicated problems if they promote a holistic awareness of the consequences and promise of these technologies.In conclusion, the long-term outlook for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is fraught with both exciting potential and daunting obstacles. Researchers, politicians, and business stakeholders must work together to navigate the unknown seas ahead as new technologies continue to reshape financial services, governance, and social interactions. A more just, safe, and revolutionary incorporation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology into the global economic fabric may be achieved by addressing the many factors investigated in this research and following the roadmaps laid forth herein.5.3. LimitationsAlthough much has been learned by investigating cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, it is crucial to be honest about the caveats of the research. These restrictions set boundaries for the study’s results and conclusions and provide direction for future studies that try to overcome them. Cryptocurrency usage, blockchain applications, and regulatory issues are just some of the complicated themes into which this research will delve. The current research may not have gone into as much depth as necessary on certain points due13 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58to space constraints. More in-depth studies may be conducted in the future to shed light on certain issues.The study’s conclusions may be less transferable to other locations with different governmental frameworks, cultural attitudes, and technological infrastructures due to the study’s exclusive emphasis on the United Kingdom and United States. The study’s findings may not be representative of the wide range of situations and points of view found in nations with varying degrees of Bitcoin adoption. The sources and methods utilized to collect the data included in this analysis, including adoption rates, volatility indexes, and regulatory approaches, all contribute to its accuracy and dependability. The validity of the study’s findings may be compromised by inconsistencies in data quality and the presence of possible biases in data collection. Maintaining accurate data is difficult due to the fast-paced nature of technological development and legislative changes in the Bitcoin and blockchain field. The study’s conclusions, suggestions, and future directions may be greatly affected by the introduction of new technologies, the emergence of new use cases, and the development of new legislation. The research may have overlooked important ethical, social, and environmental concerns related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology due to its heavy emphasis on technical, financial, and legal factors. To tackle these facets, we must work together across disciplines and examine the repercussions for society as a whole.It is possible that the sample of reviewed institutions and currencies is not represen- tative of the whole. The study’s findings may not be representative of the ecosystem as a whole due to the limited nature of the examples used. In conclusion, it is crucial to acknowledge the study’s limits while acknowledging the useful insights into the com- plicated world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. To better understand the complex implications and dynamics of this rapidly developing field, future research should incorporate real-time data, broaden the scope to encompass a wider range of countries and contexts, and engage in interdisciplinary collaborations to address these gaps.Author Contributions: Conceptualization—U.K. and F.H.; methodology—U.K.; software—F.H.; validation—U.K. and F.H.; formal analysis—U.K.; investigation—F.H.; resources—U.K.; data curation—F.H.; writing—original draft preparation—F.H.; writing—review and editing—U.K.; visualization—U.K.; supervision—U.K.; project administration—F.H.

The current research may not have gone into as much depth as necessary on certain points due13 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58to space constraints. More in-depth studies may be conducted in the future to shed light on certain issues.The study’s conclusions may be less transferable to other locations with different governmental frameworks, cultural attitudes, and technological infrastructures due to the study’s exclusive emphasis on the United Kingdom and United States. The study’s findings may not be representative of the wide range of situations and points of view found in nations with varying degrees of Bitcoin adoption. The sources and methods utilized to collect the data included in this analysis, including adoption rates, volatility indexes, and regulatory approaches, all contribute to its accuracy and dependability. The validity of the study’s findings may be compromised by inconsistencies in data quality and the presence of possible biases in data collection. Maintaining accurate data is difficult due to the fast-paced nature of technological development and legislative changes in the Bitcoin and blockchain field. The study’s conclusions, suggestions, and future directions may be greatly affected by the introduction of new technologies, the emergence of new use cases, and the development of new legislation. The research may have overlooked important ethical, social, and environmental concerns related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology due to its heavy emphasis on technical, financial, and legal factors. To tackle these facets, we must work together across disciplines and examine the repercussions for society as a whole.It is possible that the sample of reviewed institutions and currencies is not represen- tative of the whole. The study’s findings may not be representative of the ecosystem as a whole due to the limited nature of the examples used. In conclusion, it is crucial to acknowledge the study’s limits while acknowledging the useful insights into the com- plicated world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. To better understand the complex implications and dynamics of this rapidly developing field, future research should incorporate real-time data, broaden the scope to encompass a wider range of countries and contexts, and engage in interdisciplinary collaborations to address these gaps.Author Contributions: Conceptualization—U.K. and F.H.; methodology—U.K.; software—F.H.; validation—U.K. and F.H.; formal analysis—U.K.; investigation—F.H.; resources—U.K.; data curation—F.H.; writing—original draft preparation—F.H.; writing—review and editing—U.K.; visualization—U.K.; supervision—U.K.; project administration—F.H.

Based on a total of 67 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database, this study adopts a bibliometrics and content analysis approach which uses both numerical and visualization techniques to examine the extant literature. It spans the timeframe between 2016 and 2022. Bibliometrix R-package (Biblioshiny, version 4 is employed to analyze the descriptive analysis, which includes publication trends, the most trustworthy sources of scientiﬁc pub- lications, prominent scientiﬁc authors, prominent documents, and country collaborations. VOSviewer software Version 1.6.20, is used for a network visualization of keywords and bibliographic coupling. Leveraging the content analysis, this research reveals three fundamental themes: ﬁrst, the use of blockchain technology to strengthen ﬁnancial reporting systems; second, blockchain technology and the future of auditing; and third, the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Research gaps in the current literature include a lack of comprehensive studies on blockchain’s regulatory and governance aspects in accounting, insufﬁcient exploration of risks and challenges in adopting new technologies in au- diting, and a limited understanding of tax consequences, disclosure requirements, and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, necessitating future research endeavors. Thus, this study extends existing theoretical insights by exploring blockchain’s role in ﬁnancial reporting, its transforma- tive impact on auditing, and the possible adaptation or development of new valuation methods for cryptocurrencies.

Data Extraction and Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaFor this bibliometric analysis, the Web of Science Core database was searched exten- sively beginning in January 2023 in order to gather data regarding the papers. A systematic search was performed, including the title, abstract, and keyword list, utilizing the speciﬁed terms “blockchain in accounting” OR “blockchain in auditing.” This meticulous process yielded the discovery of a total of 999 scholarly publications. The study employed strin- gent criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and a comprehensive search was subsequently conducted using the terms “Economics” and “Management.” This process yielded a cu- rated selection of 402 scientiﬁc papers. These domains exhibit a strong correlation with accounting and auditing, thereby offering a complete comprehension of the economic and managerial implications associated with the use of blockchain technology in accounting and auditing practices. The utilization of these speciﬁc keywords aligns with prior bibliometrics investigations into the application of blockchain technology in the ﬁelds of accounting and auditing, as demonstrated by the scholarly works described in [4,93]. Incorporating these7 of 26Sustainability 2023, 15, 16887speciﬁc terms into the search strategy guarantees that the study encompasses pertinent scholarly literature that offers valuable perspectives on the economic and managerial con- sequences of blockchain technology in the ﬁelds of accounting and auditing. Following this, the scope was reﬁned to encompass scholarly articles exclusively published in the English language within the disciplines of economics, business, business ﬁnance, and man- agement. As a result, a total of 203 pertinent academic publications were identiﬁed. A more precise selection was made by implementing ﬁlters to exclusively include papers classiﬁed as “Article” or “Early Access” and published within the timeframe of 2016 to 2022. This resulted in a ﬁnal corpus consisting of 67 articles. The search technique and criteria for source selection were developed with the aim of maintaining a rigorous and high level of quality, as indicated in [47]. The chosen methodological approach is consistent with the norms of bibliometric analysis and guarantees the thorough inclusion of pertinent scholarly literature in the domain of blockchain in accounting and auditing.  3.2.

Literature Review: The advent of cryptocurrencies and the development of blockchain technology have been transformative and paradigm-shifting forces in the world of finance, prompting the need to rethink long-held assumptions and standards. This literature study delves into the complex world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, analyzing its effects on the banking industry in the UK and USA, the stock market, and other areas related to finance. This study aims to provide complete knowledge of the developing role of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the financial sector by reviewing a wide variety of academic publications, empirical investigations, and industry reports.2.1. Cryptocurrencies: Transforming Financial MarketsAccording to recent research, cryptocurrencies have the ability to fundamentally alter existing monetary systems (Chang et al. 2019). Beyond their function as digital instruments of trade, the complexities of cryptocurrencies are investigated here. They may, nevertheless, serve as powerful disruptors, sparking fundamental changes in market dynamics (Chang et al. 2019). Digital currencies, spearheaded by the revolutionary Bitcoin, are a new kind of investment3 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58instrument that defies established conventions. Research by academics like Baur et al. (2018) and Cheah and Fry (2015) highlights the diversification advantages of Bitcoin investing. In addition, the research shows how the incorporation of these methods into conventional portfolios has altered the risk profiles of investment strategies (Osmani et al. 2020).The rise of cryptocurrencies as a separate asset class has prompted a rethinking of how investors diversify their holdings. Their infancy is a factor in the extreme volatility that has been compared to both speculative bubbles and game-changing breakthroughs (Gandal et al. 2018; Sadiq et al. 2023). It is important to note that market mood and investor behavior have a significant impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies (Gandal et al. 2018). Recent market changes have emphasized the need for investors in the United Kingdom and United States to review their risk tolerance and investing strategies. Cryptocurrency adoption adds a new level of complexity to existing risk management systems, which might have far-reaching effects on the international financial system (Chen and Bellavitis 2019). Narayanan et al. (2020) argues that the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies to traditional financial institutions represents a paradigm shift. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is shaking up a financial system that has relied on centralized institutions for decades (Narayanan et al. 2020). Remittances, foreign payments, and peer-to-peer deals are all impacted by the use of cryptography, which in turn influences the environment in which these activities may take place (Narayanan et al. 2020).Inquiries into the consequences for monetary policy and financial stability are war- ranted in light of the fact that cryptocurrencies provide a serious threat to the monopoly of central banks in currency supply (Yermack 2013). Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are gaining momentum as a reaction to Bitcoin’s popularity (Prasad 2014). As a result, the dynamic between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies creates a complicated nexus that calls for careful analysis within the context of the development of financial markets. Cryptocurren- cies have progressed well beyond their original function as digital tokens, ushering in a new age of unparalleled upheaval inside monetary institutions (Duchenne 2018). Portfolio diversification, volatility in the United Kingdom and United States financial markets, and reevaluation of traditional financial intermediaries are only some of the topics that will be discussed in the next discussion (Duchenne 2018). The emergence of cryptocurrencies has also sparked discussions about the central banks of the future and the far-reaching effects this may have on monetary systems. Cryptocurrencies will have long-lasting effects on financial markets, forcing established players to rethink their strategies and grab new possibilities presented by the ongoing digital transformation.The next sections will dive into the evolution of conventional banking institutions to reflect these new realities, and the possible uses of blockchain technology in the financial industry will be investigated.2.2. Adapting Traditional Banking SystemsThe introduction of cryptocurrencies marked the beginning of a new age of financial innovation, forcing traditional banking institutions to undertake a radical transformation to maintain their relevance in the modern digital economy. Traditional financial institutions are adapting to the possibilities and threats posed by the cryptocurrency revolution, and this section looks into that nuanced process. Traditional financial institutions have been forced to rethink and retool their operations in light of the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies. Casu and Girardone (2010) explain how the sudden popularity of cryptocurrencies has forced banks in the United Kingdom and United States to rethink their strategies and place greater emphasis on customer service. Traditional banks are struggling to meet the increased client demand for easy access and administration of both traditional fiat money and digital assets. Financial institutions have been motivated to investigate possible collaborations with fintech businesses since the introduction of cryptocurrencies into the fabric of conventional banking systems has sparked a surge of innovation. Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, has sparked partnerships between traditional financial institutions and fintech startups. Financial institutions are using blockchain4 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58technology to improve the safety and speed of local and international money transfers, settlements, and regulatory compliance, according to research by Mullen and Finn (2022). Central banks have initiated their own investigation into digital money in the form of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in reaction to the cryptocurrency revolution. Central banks have developed CBDCs as a strategic step toward digital innovation while maintaining authority over currency issues and monetary policy. The subtle balance aimed for by CBDCs is emphasized by Prasad (2014). Thomason et al. (2018) discuss the ramifications of this seismic shift towards CBDCs for traditional financial institutions, including the need for modifications to risk management, client services, and overall business strategies. As Bitcoin transactions become more accepted, traditional banks in the United Kingdom and United States have the significant task of reducing risks connected with this development. These dangers include, among other things, increased vulnerability to cyberattack and the possibility of being entangled in illegal activity. Raskin et al. (2020) highlight the need for cyber security and keeping up with the ever-changing AML and KYC laws as cornerstones of effective risk management strategies. Traditional financial institutions that are implementing the integration of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have a duty to educate and engage their customers in a fast-digitizing financial environment. To help customers make the shift from traditional banking to the new digital financial paradigm, it is crucial to implement clear communication methods and intuitive interfaces.Traditional financial institutions need to take the initiative to adapt to the revolu- tionary effects of Bitcoin. As a result of the ongoing digital disruption, these institutions are engaging in complex processes of adaptation, including the reevaluation of business models, promotion of innovation through collaboration, and negotiating the murky waters of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. In the modern era of computing, blockchain technology has expanded well beyond its roots as the underlying technology of cryptocur- rencies, revealing several ground-breaking uses in the banking and finance industries. In this article, we will look at how blockchain’s revolutionary properties go far beyond finan- cial transactions. Trade settlement, supply chain financing, decentralized financial services, better compliance, and democratized access to investment possibilities are just a few of the areas that are discussed in relation to blockchain’s role in catalyzing innovation. Smart contracts are at the forefront of the revolutionary possibilities of blockchain technology. The potential of smart contracts to revolutionize traditional financial procedures has piqued a lot of people’s interests. Smart contracts are becoming more popular in areas such as trade settlement and supply chain finance, as noted by scholar Kshetri (2017). By automating contractual responsibilities, smart contracts improve productivity, decrease the chance of disagreement, and speed up the conclusion of complex transactions. Smart contracts have the potential to improve efficiency and reliability in the supply chain finance industry. Proof of blockchain’s transformative impact, DeFi threatens the relevance of middlemen in the financial services industry. DeFi is a blockchain-inspired financial platform that enables permissionless lending, borrowing, and trading, as described in detail by Casey (2020). By eliminating the need for banks and other financial institutions, DeFi gives its customers more freedom and independence while conducting international financial transactions.There are far-reaching consequences for regulatory compliance in the financial sector due to the irreversible and transparent nature of blockchain technology. Blockchain, as emphasized by Dai and Vasarhelyi (2017), has the ability to improve Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering systems, simplifying compliance procedures by providing a trusted and verifiable record of transactions. Because of this, financial institutions have to deal with less paperwork, and the battle against financial crime is strengthened (Hasan et al. 2023b). The tokenization of assets is a major step forward in ensuring that more people have access to financial resources. The capacity of blockchain to provide fractional ownership of assets like real estate and stocks is highlighted by Böhme et al. (2015). Tokenization paves the way for investors to diversify their holdings by purchasing smaller portions of high-value assets. Tokenizing assets on blockchain makes investing more accessible and helps more people participate in the economy. Automation, decentralization, transparency, and democratic5 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58governance are just some of the emerging possibilities as blockchain’s financial applications develop. While decentralized banking challenges the foundation of traditional financial services, smart contracts reimagine the effectiveness of contractual agreements. Blockchain technology paves the way for a more accessible investing environment by making asset tokenization and faster regulatory procedures possible. As we explore the complex realm of policy and regulation in the following sections, it will become clear that the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology necessitates a balanced approach between innovative solutions and regulatory frameworks.', '2 Cryptocurrencies and neoclassical finance: Cryptocurrencies can be used both as a means of payment and as a financial asset. Glaser et al. (2014) provide evidence that, at least for the Bitcoin, the main rea- son to purchase a cryptocurrency is speculative investment. Financial securities, such as ETNs (exchange traded notes) and CFDs (derivative products) that replicate Bitcoin’s price performance are made available by brokers, expanding the specula- tive investment opportunities to an even larger set of investors. With this in mind, it makes sense to evaluate cryptocurrencies as financial assets.The cross-section of cryptocurrency returns has been analyzed in a number of papers. Urquhart (2016) shows that Bitcoin returns do not follow random walk, based on which he concludes the Bitcoin market exhibits a significant degree of inefficiency, especially in the early years of existence. Corbet et al. (2018)analyze, in the time and frequency domains, the relationship between the return of three differ- ent cryptocurrencies and a variety of other financial assets, showing lack of relation- ship between crypto- and other assets. Liu and Tsyvinski (2018) investigate whether cryptocurrency pricing bears similarity to stocks: none of the risk factors explaining movements in stock prices applies to cryptocurrencies in their sample. Moreover, movements in exchange rates, commodity prices, or macroeconomic factors of tra- ditional significance for other assets play little to none role for most cryptocurren- cies. The latter invalidates the view on cryptocurrencies as substitutes to monies, or as a store of value (like gold), and rather stresses they are assets of their own class. The review of the literature in Corbet et al. (2019) summarizes the most interesting findings on the role of cryptocurrencies as a credible investment asset class and as a valuable and legitimate payment system.The relative isolation of cryptocurrencies from more traditional financial assets suggests cryptocurrencies may offer diversification benefits for investors with short investment horizons. Bouri et al. (2017) as well as Baur et al. (2018) find that Bit- coin is suitable for diversification purposes as its returns are uncorrelated with those of most major assets. Interestingly, they provide empirical evidence of the predomi- nant usage of Bitcoins as speculative assets, though this is done on the data on USD transactions only and thus likely reflects the behavior of U.S. cryptocurrency inves- tors mainly. Relatedly, Adhami and Guegan (2020) find that similarly to cryptocur- rencies, cryptotokens are also a useful diversification device though not a hedge.One way to understand similarities and differences between cryptocurrencies and more traditional financial assets is to estimate relationships known for traditional assets.

This special issue includes a contribution by Figà-Talamanca (2020), who, inter alia, investigate this relationship for cryptocurrencies, along with the impact of “relevant events”, which are key disruptive changes to the market infrastructure. They find that Bitcoin trad- ing volume does not affect its returns but detect a positive effect of Bitcoin trad- ing volumes on return volatility. While their focus is mainly on market attention, these results highlight similar forces rule cryptocurrency markets and those for more traditional financial assets, again supporting the view of cryptocurrencies as invest- ment assets.12The risk of holding cryptocurrencies is discussed in this special issue by Fan- tazzini and Zimin (2020). Cryptocurrency prices may drop dramatically because of a revealed scam or suspected hack, or other hidden problems. For example, on June 26th, 2019, the Bitcoin price lost more than 10 % of the value in a few minutes because of the crashes and outages of the Coinbase digital exchange. As a conse- quence, a cryptocoin may become illiquid and its value may substantially decline. Fantazzini and Zimin (2020) propose a set of models to estimate the risk of default of cryptocurrencies, which is back-tested on 42 digital coins. The authors make an important point in extending the traditional risk analysis to cryptocurrencies and making an attempt to distinguish between market risk and credit risk for them. The former, as typical in the finance literature, is associated with movements in prices of other assets. The latter is associated in traditional finance with the failure of the counterparty to repay, but as cryptocurrencies presume no repayments, defining credit risk for them is tricky. The authors’ approach is to see the “credit” risk of cryptocurrency in the possibility of them losing credibility among users, and thus becoming value-less, or “dead”. The authors find, notably, that the market risk of cryptocurrencies is driven by Bitcoin, suggesting some degree of homogeneity in the cryptomarket. As for the credit risk, the traditional credit scoring models based on the previous month trading volume, the one-year trading volume and the average yearly Google search volume work remarkably well, suggesting indeed a similarity between the newly defined credit risk for cryptocurrencies and the one traditionally used for other asset classes.']\n  - retrieval context: ['2. Literature Review: The advent of cryptocurrencies and the development of blockchain technology have been transformative and paradigm-shifting forces in the world of finance, prompting the need to rethink long-held assumptions and standards. This literature study delves into the complex world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, analyzing its effects on the banking industry in the UK and USA, the stock market, and other areas related to finance. This study aims to provide complete knowledge of the developing role of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the financial sector by reviewing a wide variety of academic publications, empirical investigations, and industry reports.2.1. Cryptocurrencies: Transforming Financial MarketsAccording to recent research, cryptocurrencies have the ability to fundamentally alter existing monetary systems (Chang et al. 2019). Beyond their function as digital instruments of trade, the complexities of cryptocurrencies are investigated here. They may, nevertheless, serve as powerful disruptors, sparking fundamental changes in market dynamics (Chang et al. 2019). Digital currencies, spearheaded by the revolutionary Bitcoin, are a new kind of investment3 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58instrument that defies established conventions. Research by academics like Baur et al. (2018) and Cheah and Fry (2015) highlights the diversification advantages of Bitcoin investing. In addition, the research shows how the incorporation of these methods into conventional portfolios has altered the risk profiles of investment strategies (Osmani et al. 2020).The rise of cryptocurrencies as a separate asset class has prompted a rethinking of how investors diversify their holdings. Their infancy is a factor in the extreme volatility that has been compared to both speculative bubbles and game-changing breakthroughs (Gandal et al. 2018; Sadiq et al. 2023). It is important to note that market mood and investor behavior have a significant impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies (Gandal et al. 2018). Recent market changes have emphasized the need for investors in the United Kingdom and United States to review their risk tolerance and investing strategies. Cryptocurrency adoption adds a new level of complexity to existing risk management systems, which might have far-reaching effects on the international financial system (Chen and Bellavitis 2019). Narayanan et al. (2020) argues that the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies to traditional financial institutions represents a paradigm shift. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is shaking up a financial system that has relied on centralized institutions for decades (Narayanan et al. 2020). Remittances, foreign payments, and peer-to-peer deals are all impacted by the use of cryptography, which in turn influences the environment in which these activities may take place (Narayanan et al. 2020).Inquiries into the consequences for monetary policy and financial stability are war- ranted in light of the fact that cryptocurrencies provide a serious threat to the monopoly of central banks in currency supply (Yermack 2013). Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are gaining momentum as a reaction to Bitcoin’s popularity (Prasad 2014). As a result, the dynamic between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies creates a complicated nexus that calls for careful analysis within the context of the development of financial markets. Cryptocurren- cies have progressed well beyond their original function as digital tokens, ushering in a new age of unparalleled upheaval inside monetary institutions (Duchenne 2018). Portfolio diversification, volatility in the United Kingdom and United States financial markets, and reevaluation of traditional financial intermediaries are only some of the topics that will be discussed in the next discussion (Duchenne 2018). The emergence of cryptocurrencies has also sparked discussions about the central banks of the future and the far-reaching effects this may have on monetary systems. Cryptocurrencies will have long-lasting effects on financial markets, forcing established players to rethink their strategies and grab new possibilities presented by the ongoing digital transformation.The next sections will dive into the evolution of conventional banking institutions to reflect these new realities, and the possible uses of blockchain technology in the financial industry will be investigated.2.2. Adapting Traditional Banking SystemsThe introduction of cryptocurrencies marked the beginning of a new age of financial innovation, forcing traditional banking institutions to undertake a radical transformation to maintain their relevance in the modern digital economy. Traditional financial institutions are adapting to the possibilities and threats posed by the cryptocurrency revolution, and this section looks into that nuanced process. Traditional financial institutions have been forced to rethink and retool their operations in light of the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies. Casu and Girardone (2010) explain how the sudden popularity of cryptocurrencies has forced banks in the United Kingdom and United States to rethink their strategies and place greater emphasis on customer service. Traditional banks are struggling to meet the increased client demand for easy access and administration of both traditional fiat money and digital assets. Financial institutions have been motivated to investigate possible collaborations with fintech businesses since the introduction of cryptocurrencies into the fabric of conventional banking systems has sparked a surge of innovation. Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, has sparked partnerships between traditional financial institutions and fintech startups. Financial institutions are using blockchain4 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58technology to improve the safety and speed of local and international money transfers, settlements, and regulatory compliance, according to research by Mullen and Finn (2022). Central banks have initiated their own investigation into digital money in the form of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in reaction to the cryptocurrency revolution. Central banks have developed CBDCs as a strategic step toward digital innovation while maintaining authority over currency issues and monetary policy. The subtle balance aimed for by CBDCs is emphasized by Prasad (2014). Thomason et al. (2018) discuss the ramifications of this seismic shift towards CBDCs for traditional financial institutions, including the need for modifications to risk management, client services, and overall business strategies. As Bitcoin transactions become more accepted, traditional banks in the United Kingdom and United States have the significant task of reducing risks connected with this development. These dangers include, among other things, increased vulnerability to cyberattack and the possibility of being entangled in illegal activity. Raskin et al. (2020) highlight the need for cyber security and keeping up with the ever-changing AML and KYC laws as cornerstones of effective risk management strategies. Traditional financial institutions that are implementing the integration of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have a duty to educate and engage their customers in a fast-digitizing financial environment. To help customers make the shift from traditional banking to the new digital financial paradigm, it is crucial to implement clear communication methods and intuitive interfaces.Traditional financial institutions need to take the initiative to adapt to the revolu- tionary effects of Bitcoin. As a result of the ongoing digital disruption, these institutions are engaging in complex processes of adaptation, including the reevaluation of business models, promotion of innovation through collaboration, and negotiating the murky waters of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. In the modern era of computing, blockchain technology has expanded well beyond its roots as the underlying technology of cryptocur- rencies, revealing several ground-breaking uses in the banking and finance industries. In this article, we will look at how blockchain’s revolutionary properties go far beyond finan- cial transactions. Trade settlement, supply chain financing, decentralized financial services, better compliance, and democratized access to investment possibilities are just a few of the areas that are discussed in relation to blockchain’s role in catalyzing innovation. Smart contracts are at the forefront of the revolutionary possibilities of blockchain technology. The potential of smart contracts to revolutionize traditional financial procedures has piqued a lot of people’s interests. Smart contracts are becoming more popular in areas such as trade settlement and supply chain finance, as noted by scholar Kshetri (2017). By automating contractual responsibilities, smart contracts improve productivity, decrease the chance of disagreement, and speed up the conclusion of complex transactions. Smart contracts have the potential to improve efficiency and reliability in the supply chain finance industry. Proof of blockchain’s transformative impact, DeFi threatens the relevance of middlemen in the financial services industry. DeFi is a blockchain-inspired financial platform that enables permissionless lending, borrowing, and trading, as described in detail by Casey (2020). By eliminating the need for banks and other financial institutions, DeFi gives its customers more freedom and independence while conducting international financial transactions.There are far-reaching consequences for regulatory compliance in the financial sector due to the irreversible and transparent nature of blockchain technology. Blockchain, as emphasized by Dai and Vasarhelyi (2017), has the ability to improve Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering systems, simplifying compliance procedures by providing a trusted and verifiable record of transactions. Because of this, financial institutions have to deal with less paperwork, and the battle against financial crime is strengthened (Hasan et al. 2023b). The tokenization of assets is a major step forward in ensuring that more people have access to financial resources. The capacity of blockchain to provide fractional ownership of assets like real estate and stocks is highlighted by Böhme et al. (2015). Tokenization paves the way for investors to diversify their holdings by purchasing smaller portions of high-value assets. Tokenizing assets on blockchain makes investing more accessible and helps more people participate in the economy. Automation, decentralization, transparency, and democratic5 of 15J. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 58governance are just some of the emerging possibilities as blockchain’s financial applications develop. While decentralized banking challenges the foundation of traditional financial services, smart contracts reimagine the effectiveness of contractual agreements. Blockchain technology paves the way for a more accessible investing environment by making asset tokenization and faster regulatory procedures possible. As we explore the complex realm of policy and regulation in the following sections, it will become clear that the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology necessitates a balanced approach between innovative solutions and regulatory frameworks.', '2 Cryptocurrencies and neoclassical finance: Cryptocurrencies can be used both as a means of payment and as a financial asset.
